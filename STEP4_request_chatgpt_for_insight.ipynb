            "Hello, student! I'm glad to see you're interested in the projections from the frontal pole (FRP) of the mouse brain. The FRP is a part of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in various higher cognitive functions such as decision-making, working memory, and attention.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FRP projects to several brain regions, including but not limited to:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Other regions within the prefrontal cortex: The FRP has reciprocal connections with other areas of the prefrontal cortex, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). These connections help in integrating information across different prefrontal areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Sensory and motor cortices: The FRP sends projections to the primary and secondary motor cortices (M1 and M2) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). These connections are crucial for the planning and execution of goal-directed actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Basal ganglia: The FRP projects to the striatum, a key component of the basal ganglia, which is involved in motor control, reward, and reinforcement learning. This connection is essential for goal-directed behavior and decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Thalamus: The FRP sends projections to various thalamic nuclei, including the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and the ventral anterior-lateral complex (VAL). These connections are important for the regulation of attention and the integration of sensory information.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Hippocampus: The FRP has connections with the hippocampus, which is involved in learning and memory. This connection may play a role in the integration of contextual information during decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Amygdala: The FRP projects to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is involved in emotional processing and the formation of emotional memories. This connection is crucial for the integration of emotional information during decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Brainstem: The FRP sends projections to various brainstem nuclei, including the locus coeruleus (LC) and the raphe nuclei. These connections are essential for the regulation of arousal and attention.\n",
            "\n",
            "These are just some of the main projections from the FRP in the mouse brain. It's important to note that the connectivity patterns may vary between individual mice and can be influenced by factors such as age, sex, and genetic background. Additionally, the functional significance of these connections may depend on the specific context and the behavioral task being performed.\n",
            "Completion B. 脳構造ツリーなし, 解析リストあり\n",
            "Based on your analysis, it appears that the injections to the frontal pole (FRP) of the mouse brain project mainly to the caudoputamen (CP) and various layers of the secondary motor area (MOs), as well as other regions such as the thalamus and agranular insular area. Here are some insights into these connections:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Caudoputamen (CP): The CP is a part of the basal ganglia, which is involved in the regulation of motor functions, learning, and habit formation. The strong projection from the FRP to the CP suggests that the frontal pole may play a role in modulating these functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Secondary motor area (MOs): The MOs is involved in the planning and execution of motor actions. The projections from the FRP to various layers of the MOs (layers 1, 2/3, 5, and 6a) indicate that the frontal pole may have a role in the higher-order control of motor functions, possibly integrating cognitive and sensory information to guide motor actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Thalamic nuclei: The projections to the ventral anterior-lateral complex (VAL), ventral medial nucleus (VM), posterior complex (PO), reticular nucleus (RT), central medial nucleus (CM), and paracentral nucleus (PCN) of the thalamus suggest that the FRP may have a role in modulating thalamocortical circuits, which are important for sensory processing, attention, and consciousness.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Agranular insular area (AId): The AId is involved in processing and integrating sensory, emotional, and cognitive information. The projections from the FRP to various layers of the AId (layers 1, 2/3, 5, and 6a) suggest that the frontal pole may play a role in the integration of this information, possibly contributing to decision-making and emotional regulation.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Orbital area (ORBl): The projections to the lateral part of the orbital area (layers 5 and 6a) suggest that the FRP may also be involved in the modulation of the orbitofrontal cortex, which is implicated in reward processing, decision-making, and emotion regulation.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the connectivity patterns observed in your analysis suggest that the frontal pole may play a role in the higher-order control of motor functions, integration of sensory, cognitive, and emotional information, and modulation of thalamocortical circuits. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific functions of these connections and their implications for behavior and cognition in mice.\n",

            "2. Secondary motor area (MOs) layers 1, 2/3, 5, and 6a: The MOs is involved in the planning and execution of motor actions. The projections from the FRP to various layers of MOs indicate that the FRP might have a role in modulating motor actions based on cognitive inputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Ventral anterior-lateral complex of the thalamus (VAL) and Ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus (VM): These thalamic nuclei are involved in motor control and cognitive functions. The projections from the FRP to these nuclei suggest a role in integrating cognitive and motor information.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Agranular insular area, dorsal part (AId) layers 1, 2/3, 5, and 6a: The AId is involved in processing emotions, interoceptive information, and decision-making. The projections from the FRP to AId layers indicate a possible role in modulating emotional and cognitive aspects of decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Primary motor area (MOp) layers 1, 2/3, and 6a: The MOp is responsible for the execution of voluntary movements. The projections from the FRP to MOp layers suggest a role in modulating motor actions based on cognitive inputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RT) and Central medial nucleus of the thalamus (CM): These thalamic nuclei are involved in attention, arousal, and sensory processing. The projections from the FRP to these nuclei suggest a role in modulating attention and sensory processing based on cognitive inputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Orbital area, lateral part (ORBl) layers 5 and 6a: The ORBl is involved in processing reward, emotion, and decision-making. The projections from the FRP to ORBl layers indicate a possible role in modulating reward and emotional aspects of decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Paracentral nucleus (PCN): The PCN is a part of the intralaminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and is involved in motor control and arousal. The projection from the FRP to the PCN suggests a role in modulating motor actions and arousal based on cognitive inputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the results indicate that the Frontal pole (FRP) has widespread connections with various brain regions involved in motor control, cognitive functions, emotion processing, and decision-making. This suggests that the FRP plays a crucial role in integrating cognitive, emotional, and motor information to modulate behavior.\n"
