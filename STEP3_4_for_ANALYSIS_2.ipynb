            "Hello! I'm glad to see you're making progress in your research on mouse brain connectivity. The frontal pole (FRP) of the cerebral cortex is an important region involved in higher cognitive functions, decision-making, and social behaviors. In mice, the FRP receives projections from several brain regions, including but not limited to:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC): This region is involved in executive functions, decision-making, and social behaviors. It has strong reciprocal connections with the FRP, allowing for communication between these two areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC): The OFC is involved in reward processing, decision-making, and emotion regulation. It projects to the FRP, providing information about the value of stimuli and potential outcomes of actions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC): The ACC is involved in error detection, conflict monitoring, and emotional processing. It sends projections to the FRP, which may contribute to the integration of cognitive and emotional information during decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Thalamus: The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) is a key relay station for information from various brain regions to the FRP. It receives inputs from the basal ganglia, amygdala, and other cortical areas, and sends projections to the FRP, allowing for the integration of diverse information sources during decision-making and other cognitive processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Basal ganglia: The striatum, particularly the ventral part (nucleus accumbens), sends projections to the FRP. This connection is involved in reward processing and motivation.\n",

            "6. Amygdala: The basolateral amygdala (BLA) sends projections to the FRP, which may contribute to the integration of emotional information during decision-making and social behaviors.\n",

            "7. Hippocampus: The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) projects to the FRP, providing information about spatial context and memory.\n",

            "These are some of the main brain regions projecting to the FRP in mice. However, it's important to note that the connectivity of the mouse brain is complex, and there may be additional regions that have connections with the FRP. I hope this information helps you in your research!\n",

Let's discuss some of the key structures and their potential roles in the context of the FRP.\n",

            "\n",
            "4. Central medial nucleus of the thalamus (CM) and other thalamic nuclei (SMT, MD, VM, PCN, VAL): These thalamic nuclei are involved in various functions, including sensory processing, arousal, and attention. Their connections to the FRP suggest that they may provide important sensory and attentional information to the frontal pole for integration into higher cognitive processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Globus pallidus, external segment (GPe): The GPe is part of the basal ganglia, which is involved in motor control, learning, and reward processing. Its projection to the FRP suggests a role in integrating motor and reward-related information into cognitive processes.\n",

            "6. Claustrum (CLA): The function of the claustrum is not well understood, but it has been proposed to play a role in consciousness and sensory integration. Its connection to the FRP suggests that it may contribute to the integration of sensory information into higher cognitive functions.\n",
            "\n",
