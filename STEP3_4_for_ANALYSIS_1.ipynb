            "Hello, I'm glad to help you with your research on the frontal pole (FRP) projections in the mouse brain. The frontal pole is a part of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in various higher cognitive functions such as decision-making, working memory, and social behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "The FRP has been found to project to several brain regions, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Other cortical areas: The FRP has strong reciprocal connections with other regions of the prefrontal cortex, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Additionally, it projects to other cortical areas like the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and the cingulate cortex.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Subcortical structures: The FRP sends projections to various subcortical structures, such as the striatum (caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens), the thalamus (mediodorsal and ventromedial nuclei), the hypothalamus, and the amygdala (basolateral and central nuclei).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Brainstem regions: The FRP also projects to several brainstem nuclei, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and the locus coeruleus (LC).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Hippocampus: The FRP has connections with the hippocampus, particularly the ventral subiculum, which is involved in memory and spatial navigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "These projections from the FRP are essential for the integration of information across different brain regions and play a crucial role in various cognitive and emotional processes. However, it is important to note that the exact connectivity patterns may vary depending on the specific mouse strain and the viral tracer used in the experiment.\n",
            "Completion B. 脳構造ツリーなし, 解析リストあり\n",
            "Based on the data you've provided, it appears that the injections to the frontal pole (FRP) of the cerebral cortex have resulted in projections to various brain structures, with the highest projection to the caudoputamen (CP). The caudoputamen is a part of the basal ganglia, which is involved in motor control, learning, and decision-making. This finding suggests that the frontal pole may have a significant role in modulating these functions through its connections with the caudoputamen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, the data shows projections to different layers of the secondary motor area (MOs) and the primary motor area (MOp). These areas are involved in the planning and execution of motor actions. The projections to these areas indicate that the frontal pole may also contribute to the regulation of motor functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The data also reveals projections to the ventral anterior-lateral complex (VAL) and the ventral medial nucleus (VM) of the thalamus. The thalamus is a crucial relay center for sensory and motor information in the brain. These connections suggest that the frontal pole may have a role in processing and integrating sensory and motor information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, there are projections to various layers of the agranular insular area (AId), which is involved in processing emotions, pain, and interoceptive information. This finding implies that the frontal pole may have a role in modulating emotional and pain-related processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, the data shows projections to the reticular nucleus (RT) of the thalamus, the central medial nucleus (CM) of the thalamus, the paracentral nucleus (PCN), and different layers of the orbital area (ORBl). These connections suggest that the frontal pole may have a role in regulating attention, arousal, and other cognitive functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the data you've analyzed demonstrates that the frontal pole has widespread connections to various brain structures involved in motor control, sensory processing, emotion regulation, and cognitive functions. This information provides valuable insight into the potential roles of the frontal pole in modulating these processes.\n",
            "Completion C. 脳構造ツリーあり, 解析リストあり\n",
            "The results of your analysis show that the injections to the FRP (Frontal pole, cerebral cortex) projected mainly to the following brain structures:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. CP (Caudoputamen): The caudoputamen is a part of the striatum, which is involved in the regulation of motor and action planning, as well as cognitive processes. The strong projection from the FRP to the CP suggests that the frontal pole may play a role in modulating motor and cognitive functions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. MOs (Secondary motor area, layers 1, 2/3, 5, and 6a): The secondary motor area is involved in the planning and execution of motor actions. The projections from the FRP to the various layers of the MOs indicate that the frontal pole may have a role in influencing motor planning and execution.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. VAL (Ventral anterior-lateral complex of the thalamus) and VM (Ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus): These thalamic nuclei are involved in motor control and cognitive functions. The projections from the FRP to these regions suggest that the frontal pole may modulate motor and cognitive processes through its connections with the thalamus.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. AId (Agranular insular area, dorsal part, layers 1, 2/3, 5, and 6a): The agranular insular area is involved in processing emotions, interoceptive information, and decision-making. The projections from the FRP to the AId suggest that the frontal pole may influence emotional processing and decision-making.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. PO (Posterior complex of the thalamus), RT (Reticular nucleus of the thalamus), and CM (Central medial nucleus of the thalamus): These thalamic nuclei are involved in various functions, including sensory processing, attention, and arousal. The projections from the FRP to these regions indicate that the frontal pole may modulate these functions through its connections with the thalamus.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. MOp (Primary motor area, layers 1, 2/3, and 6a): The primary motor area is involved in the execution of motor actions. The projections from the FRP to the MOp suggest that the frontal pole may influence motor execution.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. ORBl (Orbital area, lateral part, layers 5 and 6a): The orbital area is involved in processing emotions, reward, and decision-making. The projections from the FRP to the ORBl suggest that the frontal pole may modulate these processes.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. PCN (Paracentral nucleus): The paracentral nucleus is a part of the intralaminar nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, which is involved in arousal and attention. The projection from the FRP to the PCN suggests that the frontal pole may influence arousal and attention.\n",
